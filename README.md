# 🎛️ Tonic Audio Plugin - JUCE Effect Rack

This project is a cross-platform audio effect rack plugin built using the JUCE framework. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and build the plugin on **macOS** or **Windows**.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before building, ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- **JUCE 8.x**  
  Download from: https://juce.com/get-juce  
  Install it and launch the **Projucer** app.

- **C++ Toolchain:**
  - macOS: Xcode (latest)
  - Windows: Visual Studio 2022 (Community or better) with "Desktop development with C++" workload

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `.jucer` — JUCE project file
- `Source/` — C++ source files
- `Builds/` — Platform-specific build files (auto-generated by Projucer)

---

## 🧰 Building on macOS

1. Open `TonicAudioPlugin.jucer` using **Projucer**.
2. Ensure:
   - JUCE modules path is set correctly
   - "Xcode (macOS)" exporter is enabled
3. Click **File → Save Project and Open in IDE**
4. Xcode will launch with the project. Choose `Tonic_AU` or `Tonic_VST3` as the target and click **Run** (⌘+R).

---

## 🧰 Building on Windows

1. Open `TonicAudioPlugin.jucer` using **Projucer**.
2. Ensure:
   - JUCE modules path is set correctly
   - "Visual Studio 2022" exporter is enabled
3. Under **Visual Studio Exporter > Extra Linker Flags**, paste:

   ```
   /LIBPATH:"$(WindowsSdkDir)um\x64" user32.lib ole32.lib shell32.lib advapi32.lib uuid.lib gdi32.lib comdlg32.lib
   ```

4. Click **File → Save Project and Open in IDE**
5. Visual Studio will launch. Set the `Tonic_VST3` project as the **Startup Project**.
6. Build the solution using **Debug | x64** configuration.

---

## 🧪 Testing the Plugin using JUCE AudioPluginHost

1. Launch **AudioPluginHost**, located in the `JUCE/Extras/AudioPluginHost/Builds` directory.
   - You may need to build it first using Projucer + Xcode/Visual Studio.
2. In the plugin host:
   - Go to `Options → Edit Plugin Search Paths`
   - Add your plugin build output folder:
     - macOS (AU): `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/`
     - macOS (VST3): `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`
     - Windows (VST3): `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`
3. Scan for new plugins and drag your plugin into the graph to test it.

## 🧠 Notes for Developers

- The `.jucer` file defines modules, plugin formats, and platform settings.
- If you make changes to the `.jucer` file (e.g., adding a new source file or module), re-save and regenerate IDE files.
- **Always commit both the `.jucer` file and your `Source/` files** to Git.

## 💬 Troubleshooting

### ❌ `LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'tonic.lib'`
Remove `tonic.lib` from:
```
Projucer > Exporters > Visual Studio > External Libraries to Link
```

### ❌ `LNK2019: unresolved external symbol juce::String`
Ensure `Tonic_SharedCode` project builds successfully. If not:
- Clean solution and rebuild
- Check JUCE modules are properly included

## 🧪 Want to Try a Quick Test?

You can build the plugin and run it inside AudioPluginHost by connecting a sine oscillator → your plugin → output speakers. This helps you visualize how your effect manipulates audio in real time.

Happy hacking! 🎶
